        <p>Unlike the hostile mobs, the animals will not hurt you at all. These are the animals that will roam
            around
            your world on a daily Minecraft basis.
            They can also be a great source for food...

            <h2>Sheep</h2>
            <p>When you generate a new world, there is a high chance you'll see a sheep right away. Some of their
                natural
                spawn colors
                are white, light and dark grey, black, and brown. If you happen to run into a pink sheep, feel lucky
                because they are rare! To breed two sheeps together to make a baby sheep, you'll need just two pieces of
                wheat. As long
                as you hold it in your hand, they will follow you.
            </p>
            <div class="container2">

            </div>
            <h2>Cow</h2>
            <p>Similar to sheep, Minecraft cows are quite common throughout your gameplay experience. They will also
                follow
                you if
                they see you are holding wheat, and can also be bred with it. Additionally, when you craft a bucket and
                right click
                a cow with it, the bucket will be filled with the cow's milk.</p>
            <div class="container2">
                <img src="images/cow.webp" alt="Minecraft cow">
            </div>
            <h2>Pig</h2>
            <p>Pigs are great to have around. Unlike the sheep and cow, pigs will only drop raw porkchop when slain.
                However, that doesn't make them useless in terms of materials. Put a saddle on one, craft yourself a
                carrot
                on
                a stick, and you have yourself a new ride. The durabilty of the carrot on a stick doesn't last very
                long, so
                enjoy it while
                you can.</p>
